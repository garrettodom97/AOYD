      <h2>
        “Captain Cozza,” Admiral VerHoeven addressed Captain Anthony Cozza, his
        face filling the viewscreen with a vexed expression. “We have received a
        distress call from the people of the Alpha Centauri System. Their
        transmission was cut short, but their situation appeared to be dire. I
        hate sending you in blind, Captain, but time is of the essence and we
        don’t have another ship to reconnoiter.”
        <br></br>“You can count on us, Admiral,” Captain Cozza said. “We will
        leave immediately. Cozza out.”
        <br></br>Within ten minutes, the intrepid crew of the Sol
        Techno-Conglomerate Starship, the S.T.C.S Downfall—a Progressive-Class
        vessel—was prepared to depart.{" "}
      </h2>
      <h2>[REVV]</h2>
      <h2>
        With a flash of her powerful engines, the S.T.C.S. Downfall jumped to
        FTL (Faster Than Light). While the Downfall zipped through space at 5x
        the speed of light, the crew prepared for the worst. Captain Cozza sat
        stoically at the center of the bridge, his chin resting thoughtfully on
        his fist as he stared out the viewscreen at the stars streaking by. The
        bridge crew worked diligently, moving from station to station like a
        well-choreographed dance to unheard music. Only hushed whispers and the
        thrum of the FTL engines could be heard.
        <br></br>“ETA thirty seconds, Captain,” Lieutenant Commander Kru, the
        ship’s helmsman, announced.
        <br></br>“Take us out of FTL,” Captain Cozza ordered.{" "}
      </h2>
      <h2>[ARTAX]</h2>
      <h2>
        With a bright flash of light, the Downfall emerged from FTL. Cozza
        stood, jaw agape in unison with his crew. A black disk rimmed with
        iridescent light the width of thousands of starships lined up
        bow-to-stern yawned before them. In the distance, the light of the
        system’s star began to fade as a trail of roiling yellow-orange energy
        was drawn into the maw’s gravitational well.
        <br></br>“We’re too late,” Lieutenant Odom, the ship’s tactical officer
        murmured from his station, his voice full of dread as they all watched
        the planet dead ahead break apart and stretch into the great unknown
        extinguishing billions of lives in the matter of seconds. Their
        horrified cries cutting through the static on an open channel
        broadcasting their call for help.
        <br></br>“You know,” Commander Nicholson, the ship’s chief engineer,
        chimed in from his station at the rear of the bridge, “this reminds me
        of an ancient earth movie where this horse gets sucked into a black—”
        Captain Cozza’s head snapped around as he gave Nicholson a stern glare,
        prompting a sheepish look from his engineer. “S-sorry. Never… um…never
        mind, sir. It’s… it’s not important.”
        <br></br>“Not the time, Joe,” Odom admonished in a whisper.
        <br></br>Nicholson offered an apologetic shrug.
        <br></br>A sudden jolt drew their attention back to the task at hand.
        Klaxons deafened those on the bridge as the ship shuddered violently.
        <br></br>“Report!” Cozza barked.
        <br></br>“We’re caught in its gravity well, captain!” Nicholson shouted
        over the alarms.
        <br></br>“Damn!” Cozza growled. “There’s nothing more we can do. We need
        to get to a safe distance. Kru, full reverse!”
        <br></br>“Aye, Captain! Full reverse!”
        <br></br>The ship bucked hard to the left and then to the right as it
        struggled to widen the gap between them and the most powerful force in
        the known universe.
        <br></br>“We’re not breaking free!” Kru yelled over the rumble.
        <br></br>“I’m no engineer,” Odom offered, “but maybe the reverse
        thrusters aren’t enough.”
        <br></br>"Good call,” Cozza agreed. “Kru, come about! Full power to
        sub-light engines!”
        <br></br>“Aye. Coming about!”
        <br></br>The Downfall banked to the right away from the blackhole and
        the sub-light flashed.
        <br></br>“Joe!” Cozza snapped, looking back at his engineer. “We need
        more power!”
        <br></br>“I’ve already transferred auxiliary power to the engines!”
        Nicholson responded. “I’m giving you all she’s got, Captain!”
        <br></br>The rumble of the sub-light engine drowned out the alarms.
        Suddenly, another alarm sounded.
        <br></br>“Captain,” Nicholson shouted over his shoulder as he looked
        over his display with concern. “The reactor’s going critical, if we
        don’t throttle back, we’ll never get out!”
        <br></br>“Damn!” Cozza growled. “Kru, throttle back.” Kru looked over
        his shoulder incredulously at his captain. “You have your orders.”
        <br></br>Kru frowned, but did as he was ordered. The rumble subsided,
        but the ship listed further into the gravity well, once again heading
        bow-first into the black oblivion.

      <h2>[TEMPORAL CRISIS]</h2>
      <h2>
        “Picking up an odd time signature from the navigational sensors!” Kru’s
        voice sounded off from the helm slower and deeper than it should have
        been.
        <br></br>“Joe, what the hell’s happening?” Cozza demanded.
        <br></br>“As we draw nearer to the event horizon, time dilates! Time is
        moving slower at the front of the ship. Before too long, the time
        dilation will cause stress fractures on the hull! She can’t handle
        existing in multiple times simultaneously! Structural integrity will
        collapse before we get sucked in!”
        <br></br>“What if we go to full speed? Can we punch through?” Cozza
        offered.
        <br></br>“No! The closer we get, the more time dilates, we’ll be torn
        apart even quicker, and slower at the same time.” Nicholson responded.
        <br></br>“There has to be something we can do!” Odom replied, slamming
        his fist down on his tactical console in frustration.
        <br></br>“I cannot change the laws of physics!” Nicholson retorted.{" "}

      <h2>[CELESTIAL ABYSS] </h2>
      <h2>
        Looking out the viewscreen, Captain Cozza watched as the bow of his ship
        started to break apart in slow-motion. Sparks began to fly across the
        bridge as bulkheads gave to the gravitational/temporal stress. Dread hit
        the bottom of his stomach like a spoonful of thick mashed potatoes. He
        stared intently into the black disk of oblivion. He could almost hear it
        speaking to him...
        <br></br>
        <i>
          I am your end. I am the devourer of space and time itself. The author
          of galactic destruction… I am… the Author of Your Downfall…
        </i>
        <br></br>“Well, gentlemen…” He breathed in deeply, pride filling his
        chest as his eyes lit upon each member his crew, his friends, his
        family. “It’ been an—”{" "}
      </h2>
      <h2>[THE ANOMALY] </h2>
      <h2>
        “Captain!” Nicholson yelped, cutting off his commanding officer’s final
        words. “Sensors are picking up something massive at the singularity’s
        center! I’m picking up gravimetric waves bleeding off it! I theorize
        that whatever that is, it’s at the heart of what’s happening here! If
        these readings are correct, that anomaly is the cause!”
        <br></br>Cozza stood abruptly, straightening his uniform. “Can you be
        more specific, Joe? Is it a ship? A station? A weapon?”
        <br></br>“Unfortunately, I don’ know,” Nicholson said before a dreadful
        gaze met his captain’s eyes. “With all the interference caused by the
        blackhole, we would have to get closer.”
        <br></br>“Well, that thing isn’t exactly giving us much of a choice,”
        Kru offered.
        <br></br>“Agreed,” Cozza said with a nod. He then turned to tactical.
        “Gary! G-gar…Garman? Gretta? G-Man?”
        <br></br>“Garrett, sir!”
        <br></br>“Right!” Garrett Odom was the newest member of the crew.
        “Garrett, ready weapons! Maybe we can disable or destroy whatever that
        is in there. I want a firing solution the moment we’re in range!”
        <br></br>“Aye, Captain!” Odom responded, his fingers flying over the
        console like a pianist to 88 keys. “Pulse cannons ready!”
        <br></br>Stress fractures began to spread like deadly spiderwebs across
        the viewscreen as hull panels ripped from the bow of the ship and pelted
        the bridge.
        <br></br>Suddenly, the computer’s voice cut through the chaos.
        <i>Warning. Structural Integrity at 74 percent and falling.</i>
        <br></br>“How much closer?” Cozza asked his engineer, beads of sweat
        forming on his brow.
        <br></br>“Another two thousand kilometers!” Nicholson replied.
        <br></br>Warning. Structural Integrity at 68 percent and falling.
        <br></br>“Kru,” Cozza barked. “ETA to sensor range?”
        <br></br>“Twenty seconds, Captain!”
        <br></br>That twenty seconds lasted an eternity. Entire sections of the
        ship were venting atmosphere—and crew—into space as the temporal and
        gravimetric stress increased.
        <br></br><i>Warning. Structural Integrity at 64 percent and falling.</i>
        <br></br>A soft alarm sounded from engineering. “Got it!” Nicholson
        shouted triumphantly. “Putting it up on the viewscreen now!”
        <br></br><i>Warning. Structural Integrity at 60 percent and falling.</i>
        <br></br>Captain Cozza stared at the anomaly, eyes wide, jaw agape. “My
        god.” he gasped. “Is that…?”
        <br></br>His eyes not leaving the viewscreen, Nicholson replied. “I’m
        afraid it is, Captain.”
        <br></br>“How’s that possible?” Kru asked from his station.
        <br></br>“I, I don’t know… but sensors confirm. It’s…”{" "}
